# UWStudyGroup

http://uwstudygroup.herokuapp.com/

An app to find study groups at the University of Waterloo by looking up their course code. The groups are accurately shown at the correct buildings using the coordinates from the <a href="https://github.com/uWaterloo/api-documentation">UWAPI</a>.
The groups are either hosted by students or TAs and also contain the number of people there.
